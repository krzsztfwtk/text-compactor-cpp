Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish Renaissance polymath, 
active as a mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic canon. 
He formulated a model of the universe that placed 
the Sun rather than Earth at its center. 
It triggered the Copernican Revolution and made 
a pioneering contribution to the Scientific Revolution, pampampam.
Copernicus was born and died in Royal Prussia, 
a region that had been part of the Kingdom of Poland since 1466. 
His father was a merchant from Kraków and his mother was the 
daughter of a wealthy Toruń merchant.
Nicolaus was the youngest of four children.
His sister Katharina married the businessman and Toruń city councilor Barthel Gertner and left five children, whom Copernicus looked after to the end of his life.
Copernicus is postulated to have spoken Latin, German, and Polish with equal fluency.
